        <h2>About Rosalind Franklin</h2>
        <p>
          Rosalind Elsie Franklin was a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work provided key insights
          into the structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her meticulous experimental technique and
          sharp scientific insight were instrumental in one of the most important discoveries in modern biology.
        </p>

        <h3>Early Life & Education</h3>
        <p>
          Born in London in 1920, Franklin showed exceptional academic ability from an early age. She studied natural
          sciences at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she developed an interest in physical chemistry and experimental
          methods that would shape her career.
        </p>

        <h3>X-ray Crystallography & Photo 51</h3>
        <p>
          At King’s College London, Franklin used X-ray crystallography to investigate the structure of DNA. Her precise
          measurements and high-quality diffraction images revealed critical information about DNA’s helical structure,
          notably captured in the famous “Photo 51.”
        </p>

        <h3>DNA and Beyond</h3>
        <p>
          While her contributions to the DNA model were not fully recognized during her lifetime, Franklin went on to
          make significant discoveries on the structures of viruses and other complex molecules. Her work laid the
          foundation for structural biology and modern molecular genetics.
        </p>

        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          Rosalind Franklin passed away in 1958 at the age of 37, but her scientific legacy endures. Today, she is
          celebrated as a symbol of rigor, perseverance, and integrity in science, inspiring generations of researchers
          in genetics, chemistry, and beyond.
